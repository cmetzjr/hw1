# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor
For this assignment, we had to refactor the existing code. Some of the changes I made:


## index.html
* replaced generic divs with semantic HTML elements
* updated the page title
* added comments to the HTML
* deleted an unnecessary div
* deleted an unnecessary closing anchor tag
* fixed internal links by changing a class to an ID
* added alt attributes for the images

## style.css
* consolidated a bunch of classes that had the same properties
* used the background property shorthand for the hero image
* each of the 3 blue areas had slightly different versions of blue, so I used the header background color for each of them for consistent branding
* re-ordered some of the classes to mirror the flow of the html
